canvas zooming, is done by flash

canvas.x , y is originally at 0, but can move around

point offset is by canvas.x , y location
		lastMouseX = Std.int(stage.mouseX - this.x);
		lastMouseY = Std.int(stage.mouseY - this.y);


pen drawing is using bresenham line algorith, pass in current scale factor so the point is aligned with the zoom
